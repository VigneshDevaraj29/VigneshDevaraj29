# 👋 Hi, I'm Vignesh Devaraj

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! 

I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Engineering** concentrating on Digital System Design at **George Mason University** , specializing in ASIC/SoC Design, Design Verification, and Silicon Engineering.

I'm passionate about designing high-performance and reliable hardware systems — from RTL design and verification to integration and optimization across the full VLSI flow. My work bridges front-end logic design and architectural exploration with back-end synthesis, timing closure, and layout analysis. I focus on building scalable, power-efficient digital systems through robust coding practices, functional verification, and hardware-software co-design.

### 🔧 Areas of Interest

- **ASIC & SoC Design** – RTL development, system-level integration, and functional correctness
- **Design Verification** – UVM-based environments, constrained random testing, coverage metrics
- **Computer Architecture** – Pipelining, memory systems, performance optimization

## 📂 Featured Projects  

- [**Smart Home Automation (RTL-based project)**](#)  
  Designed a Verilog-based Smart Home monitoring module, simulated using Vivado. Modularized RTL and TB for ease of extensibility.  

- [**AHB to APB Bridge Controller**](#)  
  Implemented a complete AMBA bridge in Verilog with FSM logic, temporary register staging, and synchronization handling between two buses.
