# 👋 Hi, I'm Vignesh Devaraj

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! 

I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Engineering** concentrating on **Digital System Design** at **George Mason University** , specializing in ASIC/SoC Design, Design Verification, and Silicon Engineering.

I'm passionate about designing high-performance and reliable hardware systems — from RTL design and verification to integration and optimization across the full VLSI flow. My work bridges front-end logic design and architectural exploration with back-end synthesis, timing closure, and layout analysis. I focus on building scalable, power-efficient digital systems through robust coding practices, functional verification, and hardware-software co-design.

### 🔧 Areas of Interest

- **ASIC & SoC Design** – RTL development, system-level integration, and functional correctness
- **Design Verification** – UVM-based environments, constrained random testing, coverage metrics
- **Computer Architecture** – Pipelining, memory systems, performance optimization
